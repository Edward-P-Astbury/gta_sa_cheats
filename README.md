# gta_sa_cheats
Console application that alters the memory address values for Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas (gta_sa.exe) version 1.0.

The health, armour, money and weapon slots values are overridden based on keyboard inputs.

All the memory address values and offsets were obtained via Cheat Engine. Simply run the application whilst gta_sa.exe is open and full functionality should occur.
